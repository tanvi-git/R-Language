<b>Experiment</b>| <b>1. Arithmetic Operations</b>

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
●	To teach the basics of arithmetic operations using an interactive simulator.

●	The purpose of the Virtual lab is to create interest in students to conduct new experiments in various disciplines.

●	With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn different aspects of R programming language by getting to understand the concepts of implementation      of arithmetic operations.

●	There might be some users who have a problem of understanding the use of arithmetic operations with just the theory in hand. With the simulator, it becomes easy to      understand.
