#### 3. Instructional Strategy
##### Name of Instructional Strategy  :     <u> Problem based.</u>
##### Assessment Method: <u>Summative Assessment</u>

<u> <b>Description: </b> There are various operators used in the R programming language. We have presented a few most commonly used operators.Users can try these operators to learn various concepts of Arithmetic operators as shown below in the table. <br></u>
Sr. No |   Operator   |   Description   
:--|:--|:--:
1.| + |<div align="justify">Addition  
2.| – |<div align="justify">Subtractionn 
3.| * |<div align="justify">Multiplication  
4.| / |<div align="justify">Division  
5.| ^ |<div align="justify">Exponential
6.| %% |<div align="justify">Remainder    
7.| %/% |<div align="justify">Quotient   
<br>
 
<br>
 <div align="justify">•	The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.
<br>
•	The learner will be easily able to understand Computer Science.<br>
•	The user will able to understand the different operations of Arithmetic operators. <br>
•	With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn basics of R language as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is beneficial in understanding the basics of Arithmetic operations .
